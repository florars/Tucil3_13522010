How to run:

The software will open a window. If there appears to be no answer shown, try making the window fullscreen.

There are 3 algorithms to choose from, Uniform Cost Search, Greedy Best First Search, and A*. Enter the starting word and goal in their respective fields, then press the button of the algorithm you want to use.

The dictionary used for this solver is located in ```src/Dictionary.txt```. You can change it to another dictionary as long as the filename and extension is the same and each word is in its own line.

An alternative version that uses CLI instead of GUI exists in Main2. To run, do
```
javac Main2.java
java Main2
```
